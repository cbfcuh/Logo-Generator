# Logo Generator

## Description
This application is designed to run on the command line interface and uses Inquirer to prompt certain questions to generate a logo.

## User Story
As a developer I want to generate simple logos for my projects so that I don't have to pay a graphic designer.

# Installation
Start by installing:
<li>npm install</li>
<li>npm i inquirer@8.2.4</li>

# Usage
Once the application is completed, to start it you run the command "node .\index.js", which you will be prompt with specific questions. Once these questions are answered it will generate a logo with the file saved under the title "logo.svg".

<br>You can also test that the app is generating the shapes correcltly by running the command "npm test" in the command line.
